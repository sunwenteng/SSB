# SSB Documentation

## Summary
This Project is Based on Struts2.2, Spring3.0, MyBatis3.0 which I build for practice and need to my GameWebTools. Server is based on Apache Tomcat 6.*. I suppose this project is pretty quick for you to build a web project. I offer some practice samples within each package. The code quality is about to get improved since I no longer use java to make big project.
